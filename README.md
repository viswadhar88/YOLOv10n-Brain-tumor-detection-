## **About Brain Tumors and Detection**

### **What is a Brain Tumor?**
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or central spinal canal. Tumors can be:
- **Benign (non-cancerous)**  
- **Malignant (cancerous)**  

They may originate in the brain (primary tumors) or spread from other body parts (secondary/metastatic). Depending on size, type, and location, brain tumors can interfere with brain functions, causing symptoms like:
- Headaches  
- Seizures  
- Cognitive decline  
- Neurological deficits

### **Importance of Early Detection**
Early and accurate detection is critical for:
- Timely treatment planning (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy)  
- Reducing mortality rates  
- Improving quality of life and survival  

MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is commonly used for visualization. However, manual interpretation is:
- Time-consuming  
- Subjective  
- Prone to human error

## **YOLO and Its Role in Tumor Detection**

### **What is YOLO?**
**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm that:
- Treats detection as a **single regression problem**
- Predicts **bounding boxes** and **class probabilities** directly from images in **one evaluation**

---

### **Why YOLO for Medical Imaging?**
YOLO is ideal for brain tumor detection because of:
- **Speed** â€“ Enables real-time diagnosis  
- **Accuracy** â€“ High precision and recall, even for complex tumor shapes  
- **End-to-end training** â€“ Simplifies optimization  
- **Simultaneous localization and classification** â€“ Detects presence and position of tumors

### **YOLOv10: The Latest and Fastest**
**YOLOv10 (2024)** brings key improvements:
- Higher performance with **fewer parameters**  
- Better at detecting **small objects** (e.g., early-stage tumors)  
- Works efficiently on **low-resource environments**

This project uses **YOLOv10n (nano version)** â€“ optimized for:
- **Speed and resource-efficiency**  
- **Deployment in real-time and embedded systems**
